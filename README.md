# EDX FE Bootcamp Challenge Eight: Weather Dashboard

## The Task

The task for the eight module was to create a JavaScript program that allowed users to retrieve a 5 day weather forecast. The application would make use of the Openweather API and the use of jQuery would allow for dynamic rendering on the screen. This would also take advantage of localStorage to save user preferences.
